       <p> Zachary was hypnobirthed into this world at 12.13 on May 4th 2012.  The significance of the date of his birthday was noted by all who knew my husband.  As a huge Star Wars fan Jermaine was thrilled his son was born on international Star Wars day (May the Fourth be with you)! The force is definitely strong with this one! Zachary was a happy little baby despite a tricky start.  He was born with something called a tongue tie and his was very tight and to the tip of his tongue.</p>

        <p> Despite having this cut at 4 days old Zachary struggled to feed and despite beingh a happy and content boy most of the time he failed to gain weight very quickly.  This was exaserbated by the fact he caught chicken pox from his older sister at just 6 weeks old!  This didnt hold the little fellow back though and at 5 months he was crawling and at the tiny age of 9 months he took his first steps</p>

  <p> Zachary has grown into an amazing boy.  Despite speach and hearing difficulties caused by glue ear and the ongoing saga of his tongue tie he is an excitable, cheerful little ball of energy who is confident and outgoing.  He really is one in a million!</p>
