    <p> Our third and most probably final baby arrived 2 weeks early on 9th January 2016, a birthday she shares with her Auntie Roshana.  Eleanor was born very quickly and subsequently not breathing very well.  However after a tricky first 10 minutes she soon opened her lungs and made her presence known. </p>

  <p> Eleanor has fitted into family life seamlessly.  Her siblings adore her and her cheeky character has meant she likes to be involved in everything they do.  Like her brother Eleanor was another early walker and by 11 months was on her feet and terrorising the family.  I frequently refer to her as a monster and she most certainly lives up to this name.  She is most commonly found emtying bins, climbing anything and everything and eating anything she gets her hands on!</p>
